# Wordle game in React Native

## Homework
### Necessities
- Refresh page when game is done, choosing a new word.

### Best to have, not fundamental
- Save current progress in AsyncStorage, so that if you close the spp in the middle of the game, and then relaunch, you continue from where you started. This will prevent cheating.

- If you add a big dataset of words, you can also check if the entered word is a valid word.

- Keep track of stats:
    - number of games played
    - win rate
    - current streak
    - max streak

- Animations (for letters, words, ...)

### More advanced (needs some backend)
- save the stats in a database
- public leader board
